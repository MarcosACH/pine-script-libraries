# Objects

**Utility functions for working with object and variable types in Pine Script**

This library provides a set of helper functions that allow you to inspect and manage Pine Script's built-in objects and variables dynamically.

### Features

- `getType(this)` â€“ Returns the type of a variable or object as a string (e.g., `series float`, `input string`, `line`, `box`, `label`, etc.)
- Supports detection of `const`, `input`, `series`, and `simple` types.
- Useful for debugging, validation, and writing reusable generic logic.
